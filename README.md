# Atlas_Compiler

## Description
A source-to-source compiler that translates my languages, ATLAS, into C source code. I decided to embark on this project to learn more about: what happens when something is compiled, how C++ and C work, and what it means to design a good programming language.     

## Structure 
#### Consists of:
- Lexer (Tokenizer)
- Parser
- Code Emitter
- "Helper" classes
  - Variable.h
  - optimizer? (Future)
