# Atlas_Compiler

## Description
A source-to-source compiler that translates my languages, ATLAS, into C source code. I decided to embark on this project to learn more about: what happens when something is compiled, how C++ and C work, and what it means to design a good programming language. 


The Atlas Compiler is an independent project, and is aimed primarily at cultivating a deeper understanding of how great languages like C, C++, Java, etc are used to run technology in the modern age    

## Structure 
#### Consists of:
- Lexer (Tokenizer)
- Parser
- Code Emitter
- "Helper" classes
  - Variable.h
  - optimizer? (Future)
